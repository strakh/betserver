RUN Betserver

`docker-compose pull`
`docker-compose up`

Run Tests against it

`./test.sh`

Build Betserver locally

- open with XCode and build
- or from command line in Linux `gcc -o betserver main.c` (gcc >= 5)

Notes:
- only BETSERVER_OPEN and BETSERVER_BET message types are implemented
- server replies are still plain text.
- code is missing reorganisation into multiple files, it's currently in one .c file for build simplicity.
